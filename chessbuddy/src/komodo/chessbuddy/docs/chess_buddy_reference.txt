===== Chess.com Analysis Project =====

The goal of this project is to build an AI-powered tool that analyzes a user’s Chess.com games 
and identifies personal weaknesses, such as problematic openings, frequent mistakes, and 
recurring patterns, then provides tailored insights and recommendations to help improve their 
play. 
 Objectives 
● Let users input their Chess.com username 
 
● Automatically fetch and parse all their past games using the Chess.com API 
 
● Analyze: 
 
○ Most common openings played against 
Openings they lose to the most 
○ Mistakes/blunders/inaccuracies per game 
○ Game outcomes, colors played, and move patterns 
 
● Train a model to: 
 
○ Identify trends and weaknesses 
○ Provide actionable feedback 
 Core Features 
● Data Fetching: Pull games via Chess.com API 
 
● Game Parsing: Convert PGN files into structured data 
 
● Analysis Engine: 
 
○ Track win/loss/draw stats by opening 
○ Detect recurring mistake types or move sequences 
 
● UI: 
○ Simple interface where users see personalized insights 
○ Visuals like heatmaps, charts, or text-based summaries 

===== Core Components Design Plan =====

Core Components Design Plan 
Keshav Singh 
 
1.1 User Input & Data Fetch 
● User enters their Chess.com username 
 
● Backend fetches game archives using the Chess.com API 
Pseudo code for above 
User inputs  > usernamexyz 
 
Backend runs > https://api.chess.com/pub/player/usernamexyz/games/archives 
Returns > all monthly archive URLs from that player’s history (for each archive, it fetches the 
games for that month) 
1.2 Opening Detection (Using OpeningTree) 
● Use https://github.com/openingtree/openingtree (open-source website previously 
existing to identify openings) based on PGN moves 
Pseudo code for above 
Return opening types and probabilities of occurring -> curl 
https://www.openingtree.com/api/player/usernamexyz (analyze through given months previously 
fetches) 
1.3 PGN Parsing 
● Use python-chess(built-in python chess library) to: 
 
○ Parse PGN files for desired month of play 
 
○ Extract move sequences, player color, result 
 
○ Analyze annotations or run Stockfish to detect inaccuracies/blunders (maybe 
gemini, not sure on how to implement stockfish) 
1.4 Data structuring 
● Create some sort structured data per game  
● Store in a pandas dataframe 
Pseudo code for above 
{ 
  "game_id": "12345",

  "date": "2023-09-15", 
  "color": "white", 
  "opening": "Sicilian Defense", 
  "result": "loss", 
  "mistakes": ["move_10", "move_22"] (use of gemini, not sure exactly how) 
} 
1.5 Implementation of AI 
● Track Metrics like : 
1. Win/loss ratio per opening 
 
2. Mistake frequency by move number 
 
3. Blunder distribution by color 
 
4. Game length and performance decay 
 
5. Opponent opening frequency 
● Use Random forests to analyze pd data frames to see which factors repeat often when 
the game ends in a loss. 
 
● Use gemini or a custom rule-based engine to generate plain-language feedback 
Pseudo code for above 
model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name='gemini-pro') 
response = model.generate_content(" 
User has a  {win_rate} win rate against Sicilian Defense as {color} 
Blunders occur frequently around move {10-15}. 
Suggest 3 training tips based on this history. 
") 
to_markdown(response.text)

1.6 Presentation 
● Frontend: Maybe a web-app, simple to do using a github generated website, not sure on 
how to translate this into a familiar IDE like xCode for myself 
Features: 
1. Home: Username input + submit button 
2. Dashboard: 
 
○ Chart of win/loss by opening 
 
○ Mistake frequency graph 
 
○ Gemeni personalized advice
