The goal of this project is to build an AI-powered tool that analyzes a user’s Chess.com games 
and identifies personal weaknesses, such as problematic openings, frequent mistakes, and 
recurring patterns, then provides tailored insights and recommendations to help improve their 
play. 
 Objectives 
● Let users input their Chess.com username 
 
● Automatically fetch and parse all their past games using the Chess.com API 
 
● Analyze: 
 
○ Most common openings played against 
Openings they lose to the most 
○ Mistakes/blunders/inaccuracies per game 
○ Game outcomes, colors played, and move patterns 
 
● Train a model to: 
 
○ Identify trends and weaknesses 
○ Provide actionable feedback 
 Core Features 
● Data Fetching: Pull games via Chess.com API 
 
● Game Parsing: Convert PGN files into structured data 
 
● Analysis Engine: 
 
○ Track win/loss/draw stats by opening 
○ Detect recurring mistake types or move sequences
