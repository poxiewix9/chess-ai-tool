```

### 2.1 User Input & Data Fetch

#### Description

- The user provides their Chess.com username via a web interface.
- The backend fetches all available game archives for the user using the Chess.com public API.

#### Implementation Details

- **API Endpoint:** `https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{username}/games/archives`
- **Process:**
  1. Fetch the list of monthly archive URLs for the user.
  2. For each archive, fetch the games for that month.
  3. Store the raw PGN data for further processing.

**Python Example:**
```python
import requests

def fetch_archives(username):
    url = f"https://api.chess.com/pub/player/{username}/games/archives"
    resp = requests.get(url)
    archives = resp.json()['archives']
    return archives

def fetch_games_from_archives(archives):
    games = []
    for archive_url in archives:
        resp = requests.get(archive_url)
        games.extend(resp.json().get('games', []))
    return games
```

---

### 2.2 Opening Detection (Using OpeningTree)

#### Description

- Identifies the opening played in each game using the OpeningTree API, which analyzes PGN move sequences.

#### Implementation Details

- **API Endpoint:** `https://www.openingtree.com/api/player/{username}`
- **Process:**
  1. For each game, extract the move sequence from the PGN.
  2. Send the move sequence to the OpeningTree API.
  3. Receive the opening name and probability.

**Example API Call:**
```bash
curl "https://www.openingtree.com/api/player/{username}"
```

**Python Example:**
```python
def get_opening_info(username):
    url = f"https://www.openingtree.com/api/player/{username}"
    resp = requests.get(url)
    return resp.json()
```

- **Integration:** For bulk analysis, batch requests or local opening detection using the `python-chess` library and an ECO code database can be considered for efficiency.

### 2.3 PGN Parsing

#### Description

- Parses PGN files to extract structured data: move sequences, player color, result, and annotations.

#### Implementation Details

- **Library:** `python-chess`
- **Process:**
  1. Parse each PGN to extract:
     - Move list
     - Player color (white/black)
     - Result (win/loss/draw)
     - Annotations (if available)
  2. Optionally, run a chess engine (e.g., Stockfish) to analyze moves for inaccuracies, blunders, and mistakes.

**Python Example:**
```python
import chess.pgn

def parse_pgn(pgn_string):
    game = chess.pgn.read_game(io.StringIO(pgn_string))
    moves = [move.uci() for move in game.mainline_moves()]
    result = game.headers.get("Result")
    color = "white" if game.headers.get("White") == username else "black"
    return {
        "moves": moves,
        "result": result,
        "color": color
    }
```

- **Stockfish Integration:** Use `python-chess`'s engine module to evaluate each move and annotate mistakes/blunders.

---

### 2.4 Data Structuring

#### Description

- Structures parsed game data into a format suitable for analysis, typically a pandas DataFrame.

#### Implementation Details

- **Data Model Example:**
```python
{
  "game_id": "12345",
  "date": "2023-09-15",
  "color": "white",
  "opening": "Sicilian Defense",
  "result": "loss",
  "mistakes": ["move_10", "move_22"]
}
```

- **Process:**
  1. For each game, create a record with all relevant fields.
  2. Store all records in a DataFrame for batch analysis.

**Python Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd

games_data = [parse_pgn(pgn) for pgn in all_pgns]
df = pd.DataFrame(games_data)
```

---

### 2.5 Analysis Engine (AI/ML)

#### Description

- Analyzes structured data to identify trends, weaknesses, and actionable insights.

#### Implementation Details

- **Metrics Tracked:**
  - Win/loss ratio per opening
  - Mistake/blunder frequency by move number
  - Blunder distribution by color
  - Game length and performance decay
  - Opponent opening frequency

- **Machine Learning:**
  - Use Random Forests or similar models to correlate features (e.g., opening, move number, color) with game outcomes.
  - Identify which factors most often lead to losses.

**Python Example:**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Assume df has columns: 'opening', 'color', 'mistake_count', 'result'
X = df[['opening', 'color', 'mistake_count']]
y = df['result'].apply(lambda r: 1 if r == 'win' else 0)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
```

- **AI Feedback Generation:**
  - Use generative AI (e.g., Gemini) or rule-based templates to create plain-language feedback.
  - Example prompt for Gemini:
    ```
    User has a {win_rate} win rate against Sicilian Defense as {color}.
    Blunders occur frequently around move {10-15}.
    Suggest 3 training tips based on this history.
    ```

### 2.6 Presentation Layer

#### Description

- Presents insights and recommendations to the user via a web-based dashboard.

#### Implementation Details

- **Frontend Framework:** React, Streamlit, or similar.
- **Features:**
  - Home page for username input and submission
  - Dashboard with:
    - Win/loss charts by opening
    - Mistake frequency graphs
    - Personalized advice and training suggestions
    - Downloadable reports

- **Visualization Libraries:** Chart.js, D3.js, or Plotly for interactive charts and heatmaps.

**Example Dashboard Features:**
- Chart: Win/loss ratio by opening
- Graph: Mistake frequency by move number
- Text: AI-generated personalized advice

---

### 2.7 Example End-to-End Flow

1. User enters Chess.com username.
2. Backend fetches all monthly game archives.
3. Each game is parsed, structured, and analyzed.
4. Openings are detected using OpeningTree or local logic.
5. Analysis engine computes statistics and generates feedback.
6. Results are displayed on the dashboard.

---

### 2.8 Implementation Best Practices

- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle API failures, missing data, and malformed PGNs.
- **Scalability:** Batch API requests and parallelize PGN parsing for large user histories.
- **Extensibility:** Modularize each component for easy updates and feature additions.
- **Security:** Sanitize user input and secure API keys if using third-party services.
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests for all core modules.

---

### 2.9 Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional chess platforms (e.g., Lichess)
- Advanced training modules and drills based on user weaknesses
- Mobile app version for on-the-go analysis
- Community features for sharing insights and progress
- Real-time game analysis and notifications
